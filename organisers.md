### Step 2a - Manager Facilitator Recommendation

### Step 2c - Existing Facilitator Request

> Sorry this wasn’t your first preference. We weren’t able to find a facilitator at this time (INSERT_PREFERENCE), but we’ll hopefully find someone for the next cycle of Shadow Roles if you’re still really keen to shadow that role.

### Step 4b - Shadow Apology
> Hi INSERT_SHADOW! 👋 Thanks for submitting your shadow role preferences for the upcoming 6-month cycle. After prioritising the roles based on people’s level of interest in shadowing and their preferences, we’re not currently able to find a facilitator for your preferences, sorry! 😔 Please reach out to me directly in 3 months if you’d still be interested and we’ll check if someone might have become available 🤞
