## Shadow Holding Message
> Hello 👋 Thanks for submitting your shadow role preferences for the upcoming 6-month cycle. We’re now trying to arrange a good facilitator for you based on your preferences. I’ll get back in touch soon 👍

## Manager Facilitator Recommendation

## New Facilitator Request

> You may wish to discuss this with INSERT_MANAGER, as they recommended you as a facilitator. INSERT_COWORKER in INSERT_DEPARTMENT_OR_TEAM have taken part in this previously, so they might be able to share their experiences with you.

## Existing Facilitator Request
> Hello 👋 INSERT_SHADOW has asked to shadow an INSERT_ROLE for the upcoming 6-month cycle, would you be happy to facilitate that? I know you've previously taken part in a Shadow Role with INSERT_PREVIOUS_SHADOW.

## Facilitator Confirmation
> Amazing! Thank you 🙏 Could you please message each other to set up your first shadow session and follow the agenda in the guide.

## Shadow Confirmation
> Hello 👋 Thanks for submitting your shadow role preferences. INSERT_FACILITATOR has confirmed they’re happy to facilitate you for the INSERT_ROLE role 😊

> Could you please message each other to organise your first shadow session and follow the agenda in the guide.

> Sorry this wasn’t your first preference. We weren’t able to find a facilitator at this time (INSERT_PREFERENCE), but we’ll hopefully find someone for the next cycle of Shadow Roles if you’re still really keen to shadow that role.

## Shadow Apology
> Hi INSERT_SHADOW! 👋 Thanks for submitting your shadow role preferences for the upcoming 6-month cycle. After prioritising the roles based on people’s level of interest in shadowing and their preferences, we’re not currently able to find a facilitator for your preferences, sorry! 😔 Please reach out to me directly in 3 months if you’d still be interested and we’ll check if someone might have become available 🤞
