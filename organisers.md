## Shadow Apology
> Hi INSERT_SHADOW! 👋 Thanks for submitting your shadow role preferences for the upcoming 6-month cycle. After prioritising the roles based on people’s level of interest in shadowing and their preferences, we’re not currently able to find a facilitator for your preferences, sorry! 😔 Please reach out to me directly in 3 months if you’d still be interested and we’ll check if someone might have become available 🤞
