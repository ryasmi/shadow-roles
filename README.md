A shadow role involves two people, a shadow and a facilitator. The shadow becomes a kind of understudy of the facilitator’s role. Typically this is a sideways shift (e.g. a Software Developer shadowing a Product Manager).

## Why are Shadow Roles useful?
Feedback shows that shadow roles are having the following benefits for teams, facilitators, and shadows.

1. Connecting: Building empathy and relationships across roles.
2. Innovating: Looking at problems from new perspectives.
3. Learning: Developing new skills, career mobility, and leadership talent.

## How are Shadow Roles used?
Pairs (facilitator and shadow) schedule a recurring fortnightly “shadow session” for 30 minutes which runs for one year. In these sessions, both people typically present a current challenge they can work on together as a pair inside and outside of the session. The best pairs extend their sessions or make them more frequent and when they have to move the session, they always re-organise it within the same day or week.

Outside of shadow sessions, the facilitator can invite the shadow to other relevant meetings and the shadow can take on some of the role’s tasks and responsibilities, particularly when the facilitator is away or needs an extra pair of hands.

## Introduction Sessions
Prior to the shadow role commencing, it’s helpful to have a 15-minute Intro session for the facilitator and shadow with the following agenda.

1. Tell each other what you like to do outside work to get to know each other a little better.
2. Tell each other why you wanted to participate in this shadow role.
3. Find a day and time to repeat your fortnightly shadow session.

It may help to walkthrough this document during the session to ensure everyone is on the same page.

## Shadow Session Themes
If pairs get stuck here are some conversation starters that help to reveal things you can discuss during shadow sessions.

1. What’s got your attention and what’s your biggest challenge right now?
2. What is the pathway to the role and where can you learn more?
3. What are the boring/repetitive parts and the exciting/forward-thinking parts of the role?

The sessions also become more comfortable and enjoyable when pairs get to know each other personally with questions like “what did you do this weekend?” and “any exciting plans tonight?”.

## Early Termination
To reduce the risk in participating in a shadow role, at any time, the shadowing can be terminated by the facilitator or shadow. This usually happens when the facilitator changes role or takes on new responsibilities. In these situations another shadow role may be available.

## Quarterly Retrospective
Once every quarter, participants meet in groups for a Retrospective meeting with the goal of helping to improve shadow roles for everyone involved. Participants share what’s going well, what’s not going well, and share what they could try to do differently.

## End of Year Survey
At the end of the year, participants receive an [End of Year Survey](https://forms.gle/moHjYbx4WQ74LuvQ8) to gather feedback on the Shadow Roles to improve them for next year and to better understand the achievements & benefits of the initiative so we can encourage others to benefit from the initiative too.

## History
I created Shadow Roles in 2021, inspired by the Shadow Board concept. In the first year, I organised the initiative for 1 engineering team with 8 participants, the next year I expanded to 3 teams with 18 participants, and the following year I expanded the initiative to the entire engineering department with 39 participants. I'm now experimenting with an expansion outside of the engineering department for the wider organisation. The last End of Year Survey was completed by 92% of participants with 100% of them saying they either “have already” or “would probably” recommend shadow roles to others. I'm now sharing this document to allow other teams and organisations to organise their own Shadow Roles.
