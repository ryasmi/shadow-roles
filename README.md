# Shadow Roles
A shadow role involves two people, a shadow and a facilitator. The shadow becomes a kind of understudy of the facilitator’s role. Typically this is a sideways shift (e.g. a Software Developer shadowing a Product Manager).

## Why are Shadow Roles useful?
Shadow roles have the following benefits for a team, a facilitator and a shadow.

1. Connecting: Builds empathy and relationships with other roles.
2. Innovating: Looks at problems from new perspectives.
3. Learning: Develops new skills, career mobility, and leadership talent.

## How are Shadow Roles used?
Your pairs (facilitator and shadow) schedule a recurring fortnightly “shadow session” for 30 minutes which runs for one year. In these sessions, both people typically present a current challenge they can work on together as a pair inside and outside of the session. The best pairs extend their sessions or make them more frequent and when they have to move the session, they always re-organise it within the same day or week.

Outside of shadow sessions, the facilitator can invite the shadow to other relevant meetings and the shadow can take on some of the role’s tasks and responsibilities, particularly when the facilitator is away or needs an extra pair of hands.

## Introduction Sessions
Prior to the shadow role commencing, it’s helpful to have a 15-minute Intro session for the facilitator and shadow with the following agenda.

1. Tell each other what you like to do outside work to get to know each other a little better.
2. Tell each other why you wanted to participate in this shadow role.
3. Find a day and time to repeat your fortnightly shadow session.

## Early Termination
To reduce the risk in participating in a shadow role, at any time, the shadowing can be terminated by the facilitator or shadow. This usually happens when the facilitator changes role or takes on new responsibilities. In these situations another shadow role may be available.

## Quarterly Retrospective
Once every quarter, participants meet in groups for a Retrospective meeting with the goal of helping to improve shadow roles for everyone involved. Participants share what’s going well, what’s not going well, and share what they could try to do differently.

## End of Year Survey
At the end of the year, participants receive a survey to gather feedback on the Shadow Roles to improve them for next year and to better understand the achievements & benefits of the initiative so we can encourage others to benefit from the initiative too.
